### Example Usage for bulk ATAC-seq of TF1 cells
This guide demonstrates how to run the full pipeline on a linux machine (not the newcastle HPC).  
> - When running scripts, the warning messages "module not found" can be ignored: refers to commands left in the script so that they can be ran on the newcastle HPC with the SLURM workload manager.
> - The "group name" referred to throughout is used to select a subset of clones from all the sequencing data uploaded to the Sequence Read Archive by Ludwig _et al._, 2019. To include all bulk ATAC-seq sequencing data of TF1 clones use the group name "SRP149534". To test a smaller subset of five clones in the B11 lineage, "B11" can be used, but any combination of clones can be selected; see details in 'QC.sh' and 'prefetch\_files.sh'.  

## Summary of pipeline

Stages of the pipeline are split into 6 bash scripts. This is to allow different stages to be evaluated and adjusted if necessary before proceeding. For example: checking the quality of the sequencing data before alignment.

1. Prefetch .sra files from the sequence read archive, and convert to fastq format (prefetch_files.sh)
2. Assess prealignment quality (QC.sh)
3. Align reads to reference genome (analyse.sh)
4. Assess alignment quality (post\_alignment\_QC.sh)
5. Variant call (variant\_call.sh)
6. Visualise and explore clonal expansion in heteroplasmic variants (plot\_mutations.sh)

Scripts are generally run as any bash script: `bash SCRIPTNAME.sh`, with any required arguments.  

Additional software must be downloaded first: `bash install_software.sh`

**1. prefetch_files.sh**
===============================================
Downloads the raw sequencing data of the clones from the sequence read archive (SRR\*.sra) and converts it into fastq format.  

### Output
1. Information about which clones have been selected: "data/group_GROUPNAME_SRRs.txt" and "data/group_GROUPNAME_SRXs.txt". Contains the SRR names of the clones included under that GROUPNAME.
2. fastq files of each clone: "fastq/SRR\*\_1.fastq" and "fastq/SRR\*\_2.fastq" for the forward and reverse reads of a clone, eg. SRR7245880_1.fastq

### Information needed to run: (`bash prefetch_files.sh -h` for help/options)
- group name / previously chosen keyword used to choose and extract sequencing runs from data/SraRunTable.txt, eg. B11 (five clones in the B11 lineage), SRP149534 (sequencing runs of ATAC-seq of TF1 clones)  

### Execute
eg. `bash prefetch_files.sh --group-name SRP149534`

**2. QC.sh**
===============================================  
#TODO  

**3. analyse.sh**
====================================

Maps the sequencing reads from the .fasta files to the reference genome's sequence, to create an aliginment in the .bam format. Once aligned, mutations can be identified, eg.
<pre>
                 TTGGGGACTCTGG   
                 TTGGGGACTC     <--aligned read  
                TTAGGGGAC       <--aligned read with a potential T>A mutation  
           TCGCGTTTGGG           
       GGATTCGC                 
ref-seq: ATTCGCGTTTGGGGACTCT   
</pre>
### Stages in the script:
1. Parse arguments
2. Index reference sequence
  - Indexing makes it easier for the alignment program to search reference sequence more easily, like bookmarking and skipping to a page instead of searching a whole book.
3. Read alignment
  - Involves sorting the reads, identifying read pairs and exact duplicates
4. Extract alignment statistics
  - eg. total no. reads, no. reads aligned, no. duplicates etc.

### Output
.bam files of aligned reads, not human readable unless converted and need to be summarised to get information from them.
alignment_stats/alignment_summary.txt, gives overall alignment % per clone.

### Information needed to run: (`bash analyse.sh -h` for help/options)
- name of the reference sequence fasta file: either "nuc/hg38" (a version of the whole human genome) or "nuc/parent_consensus" (consensus sequence of parent clones)
- group name / previously chosen keyword used to choose and extract sequencing runs from data/SraRunTable.txt, eg. B11 (five clones in the B11 lineage), SRP149534 (sequencing runs of ATAC-seq of TF1 clones)
- choose a name for the outdir, eg. "bam_hg38_B11". Don't include the "/".

### Execute
eg. `bash analyse.sh --reference hg38 --group-name B11 --bam-directory bam_hg38_B11`


**4. post\_alignment.sh**
===============================================
Outputs files with detailed stats of alignment. For each clone: mean coverage, base quality, per genomic position coverage and base quality. Repeated for different thresholds.

This script summarises the alignment but is less important now, because the variant caller gives the same information but only for the exact reads used in the variant calling. 

### Stages in the script
1. Overall, Per position, and after filtering out reads with mapping and base quality filters.

### Output
alignment\_stats/\*

### Information needed to run: 
- group name / previously chosen keyword used to choose and extract sequencing runs from data/SraRunTable.txt, eg. B11 (five clones in the B11 lineage), SRP149534 (sequencing runs of ATAC-seq of TF1 clones)

### Execute
- Change the bamdir to the group name in the script (Doesn't use command line arguments yet): eg. bamdir="B11" 
- Execute script: `bash post_alignment.sh`


**5. variant_call.sh**
===============================================

Takes the alignment in the .bam files and calls all mutations and their allele frequencies. Pileup includes all raw mutations including multiallelics (after filtering for base and mapping qualities). It doesn't call mutations/"decide" which ones are valid by applying any other filters, thresholds or models: just all alleles and the no. times they occur at any site. Also outputs information in per site coverage/depth, a calculation of strand bias, no. reads supporting an allele on each strand etc.

### Stages in the script
1. Reads input bam/ directory name, group name, and makes output directory 
2. Reads in names of clones
3. Checks for reference fasta, chooses the consensus of parent clones if created (create\_consensus.sh)
4. Creates pileup of all alleles at each position

### Execute
Need to know:
- name of input bam directory (output of analyse.sh)
- choose name of output directory (informative to name after the bam directory)
- group name 
Then execute:
- change input and output directories in the script, and the group name.
- `bash variant_call.sh`

**6. plot_mutations.sh**
Call me with what you need from it Jordan, bit overly complicated and has different requirements I think hahah
